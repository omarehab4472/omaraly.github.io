Health Insurance Cost Prediction

Overview

This project predicts individual health insurance costs based on demographic and lifestyle factors such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, region, and smoking status. Using machine learning regression models, the project aims to help insurers and individuals estimate fair premiums while understanding which factors most impact costs.

Objectives

Analyze the relationship between lifestyle/demographic features and insurance costs

Handle and preprocess structured tabular data

Compare the performance of different regression models

Identify how smoking, BMI, and age affect predicted charges

Visualize trends and feature importance


Tools & Libraries Used

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, poly and non-linear

Jupyter Notebook for development and visualization

Matplotlib & Seaborn for correlation heatmaps and feature analysis


Key Insights

Smoking status has the highest influence on predicted insurance cost

BMI and age are also strong predictors of premium increases
