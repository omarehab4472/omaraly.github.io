# Financial Transaction Insights Dashboard

This project is a lightweight, presentation-ready data science project that analyzes synthetic international financial transactions and detects anomalies using simple techniques (z-score and IQR). It's designed to be easy to run and explain in interviews or assessments for finance/technology graduate programs (e.g., Deutsche Bank).

## What's included
- `data/transactions.csv` — synthetic dataset (~1200 transactions) with international names and locales.
- `notebooks/01_transaction_analysis.ipynb` — interactive Jupyter notebook showing analysis and visualizations.
- `src/` — modular Python scripts:
  - `data_preprocessing.py` — functions to load and enrich the data.
  - `analysis.py` — summary statistics and monthly trends.
  - `anomaly_detection.py` — z-score and IQR anomaly detectors.
  - `visualization.py` — Plotly charts exported as interactive HTML.
  - `generate_report.py` — script to auto-generate `reports/insights_dashboard.html` by combining charts.
- `reports/insights_dashboard.html` — (may be generated by running `python src/generate_report.py`).
- `requirements.txt` — Python packages used.

## How to run (quick)
1. Create a virtualenv and install requirements::
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Open and run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/01_transaction_analysis.ipynb
   ```
   Or generate the HTML report (script will save interactive HTML files to `reports/`):
   ```bash
   python src/generate_report.py
   ```

## What to highlight when presenting
- Explain data fields and how you generated international customers.
- Show category breakdown, monthly trends, and sample anomalies flagged by z-score.
- Discuss limitations (synthetic data, simple z-score) and next steps (time-series models, supervised fraud classifier, real-time streaming).
